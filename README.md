<h2>COVID-19 Tracker Tools Project</h2>

This site is public to assist with data analysis tools and scripts on the JHU SSE Covid feed.  We credit Johns Hopkins for their data to make our project possible.  Other data sets may be added at a later time.<br>

The <b>code</b> directory has the core python 3 code, classes, and utilities.<br>

The <b>data</b> directory is where output files are placed, as well as reference files.<br>
